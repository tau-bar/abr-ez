# Setup Guide
Because I don't want to pay $5 to publish an extension, I'm giving instructions on how to set up this extension.

1. Go to chrome://extensions/ (or {browser}://exntensions if you're using another browser which supports Chrome extensions e.g. Arc)
2. Set Developer mode to on.
3. Click "Load Unpacked", and select this repo in the file selection.
4. The extension should be loaded in your browser.
